I recently re-watched a beautiful scene from The West Wing. It is the scene where U.S. President Bartlet gathers his senior team together, they are standing around to promote someone new to his team, part of the inner circle. Before making it official the following interaction happens:  

President Bartlet: "There's a promise that I ask everyone who works here to make. Never doubt that a small group of thoughtful and committed citizens can change the world, do you know why?"
William Bailey: "It's the only thing that ever has"

This tickles me greatly for multiple reasons. Firstly, I love the idea of having this ritual for when someone joins a team. Gathering the members around and making them feel welcome because even though everyone is busy, this is important. There is an unspoken message that "You are one of us now". Secondly, the promise which is asked of the newest member speaks to the values of the team; that if you accept this role you are committing to these higher values that the team espouse. 

Every team has their unique way of greeting new people, I wonder how we can do better to welcome new members, while also showing them what it means to be part of the team?

## Where to start
- When someone new joins, gather everyone together, it's not always convenient but it is worthwhile
- Ask, how to onboard someone using the values of your company 
- Find ways to mark these occasions: onboarding, promotions, departures
- Consider, what unspoken promises does your team have to each other? How can these be celebrated & strengthened?
