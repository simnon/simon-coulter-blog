I'm trying this thing where I work more in public, hold my ideas accountable & see what it leads to. People are simultaneously over & underrated and i think theres room for me to explore that. 

So starting with this I've started blogging on some of my ideas around engineering management the goal of this is to practice my writing skills which is an area I've always lacked confidence, the best way I know to get better at something and build confidence is to practice it in public.

- Lessons Learned
+ https://metatags.io/ tags provide better experience for url previews. 
+ attribution is hard, I know my url appeared on a twitter revue newsletter or multiple but cant be sure which. 
+ understand how to use analytics ahead of time, I guess I made sure it worked but could of had more 
+ prepare copy/comments expected questions in advance
+ Have a plan of existing people to help seed likes etc, let them know in advance whats happening. Newsletter, twitter, email, slack etc. 
  + influencers DM
+ Whats the funnel, whats the actions you want them to take. 
    - In my case I thought it'd feed into my twitter followers  (+22)
+ Reddit is fun, instabanned on /r/quotes (I can't tell how many views I got from /r/sideprojects)
