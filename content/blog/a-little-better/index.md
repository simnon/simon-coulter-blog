We march onwards, not rushing, not recklessly either but little by little. This is the basis of progress, it is how civilisation has evolved and improved over time. It hasn’t happened in all areas and not all at once, but little by little. Through learning & doing things better we are building upon what came before.

I challenge you to be 1% better. How? 
- Make better decisions than you made yesterday.  
- Learn something that makes you 1% more knowledgeable on a topic. 
- Be 1% more friendly to everyone you meet. 
- Write your signature 1% clearer than yesterday.  

That last one worked well for me, I practised cursive writing every day for just a few minutes, letter by letter I saw a gradual improvement in how I write. How will this pay off, I’m not sure yet, but my birthday cards have gotten better. 

Our skin cells regenerate every 27 days, that's amazing. What happens at the end of a year when you get a little better every day. After 27 weeks of improvements, you might not recognise yourself.

The best part is that you can pass these improvements on to others. How can you empower your team to be 1% better? How can you share tools/workflows that are working for you to make the company 1% better?

## Where to start
- List areas where improving would make a meaningful impact
- List areas that will help make those around you 1% better
- Break it into 5 minute activities to improve at these areas
- Set time in your calendar to improve at every day, form this habit
- Keep a diary, write down what you improved at each day
