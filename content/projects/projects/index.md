When I'm not working or spending time with my family I'm trying to use my free time to work on projects. I'm hoping this page will grow over time.

### [ðŸ¤– Stoic Today](https://www.stoic.today/)

This project started from combination of two things I've an interest in, Stoicism & GPT3. I'd tried writing my own stoic quotes or rewriting famous quotes and it's hard. GPT3 seemed like it could help solve this issue or at least give a better seed for a quote. I love the work other companies are doing with GPT3: copy.ai flowrite, AI Dungeon so thought I should play with it.

Goal of this has been to generate stoic style philisophical quotes that seem like they could of been written by an ancient stoic philosopher. I do wonder if an A.I. could be a better modern philosopher than a 2000 year old flesh and blood stoic.
